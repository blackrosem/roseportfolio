# Description
The header part of the page displays name, picture, and links to the rest of the areas of the webpage(About me, Work, and Contact Me).
The About Me section of the page has a short description of me.
The Work section consists of five pictures.  Since I don't have any projects with which to link, when the user clicks on one of the pictures, it leads the user to the picture file.  Later on, it will take them to a project I have completed.
The Contact Me section has links to my phone number, email, and Github account.
